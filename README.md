# Predicting-water-resource-demand

Myself Nandhini and my friend Niteesh Kumar have done a ML project on forecasting city resource needs. We are predicting the demand for water resource of cities in Telangana. The dataset on water demand and related infrastructure variables directly addresses critical aspects of city resource management. By predicting water demand and assessing factors like treatment facility capacity, distribution network efficiency, and service connections, the dataset supports informed decision-making for urban planners and policymakers. It enables proactive allocation of resources, infrastructure improvements, and maintenance planning to ensure reliable water supply to residents and businesses. This holistic approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also strengthens cities' resilience to environmental changes and population growth, promoting sustainable development and quality of life for urban populations.
