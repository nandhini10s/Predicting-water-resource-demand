# Predicting-water-resource-demand

The dataset on water demand and related infrastructure variables directly addresses critical aspects of city resource management. We have taken cross sectional data of 59 cities in Telangana to predict water demand. By predicting water demand and assessing factors like treatment facility capacity, distribution network efficiency, and service connections, the dataset supports informed decision-making for urban planners and policymakers. It enables proactive allocation of resources, infrastructure improvements, and maintenance planning to ensure reliable water supply to residents and businesses. This holistic approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also strengthens cities' resilience to environmental changes and population growth, promoting sustainable development and quality of life for urban populations.
